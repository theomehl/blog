    <p>Howdy. This is my first post. How am I doing?</p>
<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't underestimate the Force. I find your lack of faith disturbing. What!? Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. As you wish. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. <strong>I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</strong> <em>Dantooine.</em> They're on Dantooine.</p>
<h2>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</h2>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
<ol>
<li>What!?</li>
<li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦</li>
<li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li>
</ol>
<h3>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</h3>
<p>I call it luck. You mean it controls your actions? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</li>
<li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li>
<li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
