Howdy. This is my first post. How am I doing? 

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't underestimate the Force. I find your lack of faith disturbing. What!? Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. As you wish. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. __I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?__ *Dantooine.* They're on Dantooine.

## I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

1. What!?
2. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦
3. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

### A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

I call it luck. You mean it controls your actions? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

* I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
* You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
* I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
